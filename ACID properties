The ACID properties are a set of principles that guarantee reliable transactions in a database system. 
ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, and these properties apply to various data management systems like SQL databases, Hive, and PySpark. 
Here's how they are interpreted and handled in these systems:

ACID in Hive
Apache Hive originally didn’t have full ACID compliance because it was designed for batch processing. 
However, starting with Hive 0.14.0, Hive introduced ACID-compliant transactions to support insert, update, and delete operations, providing more traditional database behavior.

Atomicity:
Definition: In Hive, atomicity is ensured by executing a transaction as an all-or-nothing operation.
Hive: With ACID tables, Hive ensures that either all changes in a transaction are applied or none are. This is handled via transaction managers and locks.
Consistency:
Definition: The database maintains valid states, ensuring that all data complies with constraints.
Hive: Hive enforces data consistency through transactional tables and internal checks, but it does not have as extensive constraint mechanisms as traditional SQL databases.
Isolation:
Definition: Transactions are isolated from each other, so intermediate changes are not visible to other transactions.
Hive: Hive supports isolation by using a locking mechanism where transactions acquire locks on partitions. 
This allows multiple transactions to operate concurrently on different partitions but prevents conflicts on the same partition.
Durability:
Definition: Once committed, transactions are stored persistently, even in case of failure.
Hive: Hive uses write-ahead logs and HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) to ensure that committed data is durable and will persist across system failures.
Caveat:
Hive’s ACID properties are only available for ORC (Optimized Row Columnar) formatted tables and not other formats like Parquet or Avro. 
Also, full ACID support requires Hive transactional tables to be enabled (transactional = true).
